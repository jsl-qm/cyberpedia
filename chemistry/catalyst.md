Susbtance added to a chemical reaction resulting in the speed up of the chemical reaction.

The catalyst interacts with the reactants and is such that its consumption during the reaction is balanced by a regeneration step at a later step in the reaction.

reactant+catalyst-->catalyst+product
Note: the catalyst is a reactant that is also a product

If consider reaction as mapping, then the reaction is an identity mapping for the catalyst.

enzyme=catalyst

**Key concepts:** speed up reaction, consumed+regeneration

Questions:
- do all reactions have a catalyst that exist?
- how to find a catalyst based on the reaction?
- mechanism for catalysis to happen?
- why speed up?
