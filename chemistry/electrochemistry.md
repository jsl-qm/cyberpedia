based on the modication of the chemical potential by applying a voltage between the two electrodes of an [[electrochemical cell]] in order to initiate [[redox]] reactions. This implies, however, a charge transport using an [[electrolyte]] and this scheme is not applicable ultra-high vacuum

apply voltage through a usually liquid medium such that a redox reaction is initiated
