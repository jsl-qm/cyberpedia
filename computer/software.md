A software is a set of instructions, i.e. code, that tell a computer what to do. It can be a program or a collection of programs that enable a user to perform a specific task, such as word processing or playing a video game. Software can be stored on a computer's hard drive, or it can be downloaded from the internet and installed on a computer. Some examples of software include operating systems, application programs, and utility programs.
