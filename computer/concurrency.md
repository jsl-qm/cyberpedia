Concurrency is about multiple tasks that can happen independently from one another.

multiple tasks are being executed at the same time. This does not mean that they are running together in parallel

running in parallel == executed at the same time


concurrency multiple task happening at the same time, but only one weâ€™re actively doing at a given point in time. With parallelism, we have multiple tasks happening and are actively doing more than one simultaneously.

However, with multitasking we can have multiple tasks happening concurrently, yet only one of them is executing at a given time.
