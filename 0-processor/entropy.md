is what brings a system to equilibrium. how does it bring it to 


$dQ=TdS$ entropy is the displacement if of the force temperature if make analogy with work

for a closed system, i.e. adiabatic system, with constant energy, transformation can still occur if entropy is not maximized, since equilibrium is achieved when the entropy is maximized. The direction of increasing entropy is the path to equilibrium.
