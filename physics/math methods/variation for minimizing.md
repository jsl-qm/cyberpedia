introduce variation, at a minimum a variation has no effect since for small changes the function changes slowly ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Least_action_principle.svg/1920px-Least_action_principle.svg.png) 

As the system evolves, **q** traces a path through [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (_δS_ = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (_δ_**q**)
