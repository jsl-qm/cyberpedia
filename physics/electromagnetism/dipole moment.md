Indicates that the system can be approximately modelled as two equal and opposite charges separated by a vector displacement $\mathbf{d}$, i.e. a physical [[electric dipole]], where $d$ is the distance between the charges.

So $p$ indicates the distance between two equal and opposite charges if the system was modelled as a physical electric dipole.
And the orientation of $\mathbf{p}$ indicates the direction of the system if it was modelled as a physical electric dipole.

Can be interpreted as:
- an expected value where each point in space is weighted by the charge at this point
- similarly to the center of mass, indicated the point in space where if take $\mathbf{p}$ as the origin then the dipole moment vanishes.

For a charge distribution:
$$\mathbf{p}=\int\mathbf{r}' \rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$

For a collection of point charges:
$$\mathbf{p}=\sum_{i} r_{i}' q_{i}$$

Eg.
the dipole moment of a uniform negative sphere superposed with a positive point charge at its center is 0
