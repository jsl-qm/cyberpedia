A system of total charge 0 but consisting of parts with non-zero total charge will have an induced dipole when placed in an electric field since each part feels a force from the electric field separating the charges and creating a dipole moment.

When the system is a neutral atom, the atom is said to be polarized since the plus charge is shifted one way and the minus charge shifted the other way.

The induced dipole is approximately $$\mathbf{p}=\alpha \mathbf{E}$$ where $\alpha$ is the atomic polarizability.

Mental model:
apply electric field on neutral system with components having non-zero charge-->force on each charge of system-->separation of positive and negative charges-->dipole moment
