**Physical electric dipole:**
System consisting of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance $d$ such that the total charge of the system is 0, $Q=0$.

The [[dipole moment]] of an electric dipole is $\mathbf{p}=q\mathbf{d}$.
Its electric potential is approximated by the dipole term in the multipole expansion of the electric potential and is accurate when $r\gg d$. 

Note that 

**Pure physical dipole:**
System whose electric potential is given exactly by $$V_{dip}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}$$
For a physical dipole to become a pure dipole $p=qd$ needs to be fix by taking the limit $d\to0$, $q\to \infty$.

The use of the physical electric dipole is important when modelling the effect of an external electric field on neutral atoms/molecules and polar molecules.
The condition $r\gg d$ is correct most of the time for these systems.

Also to find the electric field of a polarized object each atom/molecule of the material is modelled as an electric dipole.
