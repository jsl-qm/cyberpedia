Expansion of the electric potential in powers of $\frac{1}{r}$. To be precise, $\frac{1}{r_{cursive}}$  is expanded using a binomial expansion. The lowest term of the expansion provides an approximation to the electric potential at large $r$ and the successive terms tell us how to improve the approximation. 

$$V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int(r')^{n}P_{n}(cos\alpha)\rho(\mathbf{r}')d\tau'$$
where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r'}$.

So the electric potential of an arbitrary charge distribution for large $r$ can be approximated by a linear combination of the exact electric potential for a monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc. Or in terms of electric field, add electric field of monopole on top of dipole, ...

Note that the dependence on $\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}$, indicating that as the system contains more charges for an exact discrete case (eg. pure dipole, pure quadrupole) the potential falls off more rapidly. 
This can be interpreted as that more pair of opposite charges, i.e. pure electric dipoles, in the system has the effect of canceling the field of the opposite charges more effectively.
