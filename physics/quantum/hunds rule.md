rule 1 = Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity

An early but incorrect explanation of the lower energy of high multiplicity states was that the different occupied spatial orbitals create a larger average distance between electrons, reducing electron-electron repulsion energy.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund's_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity#cite_note-Levine-3) However, quantum-mechanical calculations with accurate [wave functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function") since the 1970s have shown that the actual physical reason for the increased stability is a decrease in the [screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shielding_effect "Shielding effect") of electron-nuclear attractions, so that the unpaired electrons can approach the nucleus more closely and the electron-nuclear attraction is increased



3rd rule: physical origin-->L and S anti-parallel then less overall angular momentum and  this means less energy since less kinetic energy, the angular momentum cancels each other in some 
(seem very soso explanation)
