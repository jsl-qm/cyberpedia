measure an observable for identically prepared states, the average value obtained from the energy measured for all the states gives the [[expectation]] value

$$\bra{\psi}\hat{A}\ket{\psi}=\braket{\psi|\psi'}$$
it measures how much the initial state deviates from its transformed state resulting from the action of the operator

the expectation value ahas the dimensions of the operator $\hat{A}$
