**global conservation law**: the total probability for finding a particle anywhere in the uinverse is conserved
**local conservation law** (in analogy to [[local charge conservation]]): $$\frac{\partial|\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^{2}}{\partial t}=-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}$$
where $|\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^{2}$ is the pdf and $\mathbf{j}=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}(\psi^{*}\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\psi^{*})$ is the [[probability current density]]. 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int|\psi|^{2}dV=-\oint\mathbf{j}\cdot d\mathbf{S}$$
where $\mathbf{j}\cdot d\mathbf{S}$ is the rate at which the probability flows outside of the area $d\mathbf{S}$.

This means that a decrease in probability in the volume V is accompanied by a flow of probability outside of V.

Is related to the continuous nature of the wavefunction.
