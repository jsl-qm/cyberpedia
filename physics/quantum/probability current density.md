$$\mathbf{j}=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}(\psi^{*}\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\psi^{*})=\frac{\hbar}{m}Im(\psi^{*}\nabla\psi)=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}(\braket{\psi|x}\bra{x}\hat{p}\ket{\psi}-\braket{x|\psi}\bra{\psi}\hat{p}\ket{x})$$
is the probability flow per unit time per unit area perpendicular to $\mathbf{j}$.
Note that the probability current density is non-vanishing only for wavefunction with position dependent phase, $\psi(x)\propto e^{i\beta x}$, since we take the imaginary part of the gradient of the wavefunction.
The probability current density indicates how the probability of the system changes in time for a given area in space. How much probability is flowing through an area in space for a given amount of time.

For a free particle $\psi=Ae^{\pm i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}$:
$$\mathbf{j}=\pm |A|^{2}\frac{\hbar\mathbf{k}}{m}=\pm |A|^{2}\frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}=\pm |A|^{2}\mathbf{v}$$

The probability current density is used to find the [[transmission coefficient]] in problems with unbound states, i.e. system moving to infinity (eg. scattering in 1d).

**Recall:** 
- property of inner-product
$$\braket{x|\psi}=\braket{\psi|x}^{*}$$
- $\psi^{*}(x)=\braket{\psi|x}$
