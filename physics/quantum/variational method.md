for a given Hamiltonian, take the expectation value of the energy of $\hat{H}$ with a trial wavefunction, and minimize with respect to some parameter of the trial wavefunction, solve for the parameter minimizing the expectation value and find an upper bound on the ground state of the system

$$\braket{\Psi|\hat{H}|\Psi}\ge E_{0}$$

becomes minimization problem

secular equation is when the trial wavefunction is a lin comb of eigenstates
