Probability density function

any normalizable non-negative functions with a finite at most a finite number of discontinuities in every finite interval

the degree of freedom in the choice of pdf through the relation between the pdf and the distribution fcn shows the arbitrariness in what number is associated to an outcome in the sense that as long as the random variable as the right distribution
