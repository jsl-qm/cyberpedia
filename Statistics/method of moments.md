$X_{1},...,X_{n}$ is a random sample of size n from a [[pdf]] $f(x;\theta_{1},...,\theta_{r})$

kth moment of the sample : $M_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{X_{i}^{k}}{n}$ where $k=1,2,3,...$

kth moment of the distribution : $E[X^{k}]$


To have enough equations to provide unique solutions for each parameters, equate $M_{k}=E[X^{k}]$ 

This is based on the empirical distribution $F_{n}(x)$ converging stochastically to $F(x)$ and hence the moments should be approx equal.
