**Relative frequency approach** : function mapping an outcome of the [[sample space]] in a [[random experiment]] to a number $p$ defined on $[0,1]$. The probability of an event is the relative frequency, $f/N$, where $f$ is the number of times that an outcome part of the event occurs throughout the $N$ experiments. This assumes that $p\rightarrow f/N$ as $N\rightarrow \infty$, i.e. that the relative frequency converges to a number in $[0,1]$.

Note: relative frequency depends on the number of experiments performed, not the number of outcomes in the sample space.


**Rational measure of belief approach** : personal or subjective probabiliy that an event occur (related to gambling and maybe bayesian thinking). 


composition of fcn with the outcomes as domain, map outcomes to n-dim point, then map set of points to prob
