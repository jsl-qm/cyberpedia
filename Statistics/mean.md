Mean/Expected value

$\mu = E[X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx$ where f(x) is a continuous [[pdf]].

$E[X]=\sum_{x}xf(x)dx$ where f(x) is a discrete [[pdf]].

Weigthed average of points of space weighted by $f(x)$.

For symmetric pdfs about a point $x_{0}$, the mean is $x_{0}$.

Can think of the mean as the center of mass of rod with weights distributed as the pdf. The com indicates the unique point in space where the weighted position vectors relative to this point, i.e. take com as origin, sum to zero. In other words, sum each position vector with the com as origin weighted with the mass at a point in space then the resulting sum is 0.
Point to which a force applied cause a linear acceleration without an angular acceleration.

### Mean and convergence of $n$ random sample from the pdf. 
The mean is the value around which the sample tend to accumulate around as $n \rightarrow \infty$, i.e. the distribution build by sampling from the pdf will converge to its expected value.
