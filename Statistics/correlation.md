$$\rho = \frac{E[(X-\mu_{1})(Y-\mu_{2})]}{\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}}=\frac{E(XY)-\mu_{1}\mu_{2}}{\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}}$$


$-1\leq\rho\leq1$ 

The correlation coefficient is a measure of the concentration of the probability for X and Y about a line in the xy-plane. Measure of the general degree of linear dependence between X and Y.

If $|\rho|=1$ then $Y=a+bX$. Y is X shifted and scaled.
If $\rho=0$ then there is no linear relation between the two r.v.


If the conditional mean of the r.v. $Y$ is linear then 
$$\phi(x)=E(Y|x)=\mu_{2}+\rho\frac{\sigma_{2}}{\sigma_{1}}(x-\mu_{1})$$

where $E(X)=\mu_{1}$ and $E(Y)=\mu_{2}$.
