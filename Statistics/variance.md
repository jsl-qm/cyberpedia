$\sigma^{2}=E[(X-E[X])^{2}]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-E[x])^{2}f(x)dx$
$E[(X-E[X])^{2}]=\sum_{x}^(x-E[x])^{2}f(x)dx$

$E[(X-E[X])^{2}] = E[X^{2}]-E[X]^{2}$

$E[X]=\mu$

weighted average of the square of the deviations of the numbers $a_{1},...,a_{n}$ from $\mu$ with weight $f(a_{i})$

$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the r.v. X and is interpreted as a measure of dispersion of the points of the space relative to the mean value, $\mu$.

Measure of the intensity of the concentration of the probability for $Y$ in the neighborhood of $E[Y]$. Want the variance of a point estimate to be small.

$Var(\sum_{i}a_{i}X_{i})=a_{1}^{2}Var(X_{1})+...+a_{n}^{2}Var(X_{n})$

[Whereas expectation provides a measure of centrality, the variance of a random variable quantifies the spread of that random variable's distribution.](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)
