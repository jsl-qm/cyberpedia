have some iid r.v. with a pdf from a known family of pdfs, i.e. know the form of the pdf but not its specific parameters

the goal of statistical inference is to define a statistic such that when experimental data are plugged in the statistic, a value for the parameter is obtained so the statistic is a r.v. of the parameter

An unbiased statistic of a parameter is one where its expectation value is equal to the parameter
