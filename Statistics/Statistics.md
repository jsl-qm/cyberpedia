The goal of statistics is to determine the unknown underlying distribution function of the observed outcomes of an experiment which are described by a random vector taking values in a space S. Apart from the data, the df is known to be part of a specified class of df's. The class of dfs is the space of vector parameter values, $\theta$, specifying a df.

The objective of statistics is to make an inference about a population based on information contained in a sample from that population and to provide an associated measure of goodness for the inference.

i.e. inference + measure of inference
