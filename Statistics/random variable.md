Function mapping one and only one, i.e. a unique, real number to each outcome of a sample space given a [[random experiment]].

Mathematically, for an outcome $c \in C'$ where $C'$ is the [[sample space]], $X(c)=x$ is the random variable with the space of $X$ being the set of real numbers $A' = \{x;x=X(c), c \in C' \}$.

The [[probability]] assigned to a set $A \subset A'$ with $C=\{c;c \in C' \; and \; X(c) \in A\}$ is denoted by $P_{X}(A)=P(C)$. A random variable carries the probability from a sample space $C'$ to a space $A'$ of real numbers.


In the case of $n$ random variables defined on the space $C'$, the random variable $X_{i}$ assigns to each element of $c \in C'$ one and only one real number  $X_{i}(c)=x_{i}$, $i=1,2,...,n$. The space of these random variables is the set of ordered $n$-tuplets $A' = \{(x_{1},...,x_{n});x_{1}=X_{1}(c),...,X_{n}(c)=x_{n},c \in C'\}$. For $A \subset A'$, $P[(X_{1}(c),...,X_{n}(c))] \in A]=P(C)$, where $C=\{c;c \in C' \; and \; [X_{1}(c),...,X_{n}(c)] \in A\}$.

<u>Note</u> : Defining multiple random variable for a random experiment means that a condition is added on how an outcome is defined compared to using a single random variable.

eg. a card from a deck of card is an outcome that can be defined by 3 random variable: (number, color, type)
