Mathematical expectation (expected value)

$E[u(x)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(x)f(x)dx$ where f(x) is a continuous [[pdf]] for the [[random variable]] X.

$E[u(x)]=\sum_{x}u(x)f(x)$ where f(x) is a discrete [[pdf]] for the [[random variable]] X.

In the above the expectations are assumed to be finite.

Mathematical expectations are linear.


[The expectation of a random variable is a number that attempts to capture the center of that random variable's distribution. It can be interpreted as the long-run average of many independent samples from the given distribution.](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html)
This means that if I have n iid samples from a pdf and take n to be large then the average of the value of the samples, i.e. the sample mean, will converge to a value called the *expected* value. And as more samples are taken, the precision with which the average will be  the expected value increases.w
